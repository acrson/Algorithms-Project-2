Algorithms Project 2

TO-DO:
    FAY:
    - Implement bubble sort
    - Implement merge sort
    
    
    CARSON:
    - Implement radix sort
    - Premake arrays before testing for best, avg, worst cases depending on array size n
    - Document how long best, avg, worst case took for each sort, with array size n = 100, 1000, 10000
    
    SERA:
    - Implement quick sort
    - Make some graphs or other figures showing differences visually

Also, maybe we should implement front end / main last this time? I think we had
a good idea trying to do it first last time but it bit us in the booties a little.
We could discuss this in greater detail though
